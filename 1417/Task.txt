At the First Lunar Casino there are new rules for playing space poker. A pack contains N cards. 
A player pays the croupier 20 space rubles and chooses a card from his pack. The croupier chooses 
a card from his pack. If the selected cards are identical, then the player wins 1000 rubles. 
If the cards are different, then he/she may win a sum not exceeding 10 rubles. This sum depends 
on the cards that have been chosen and is specied in the prize-table.
Your task is to write a program that tells the croupier which card to choose in order to maximize 
the mean profit of the casino. It is supposed that all players know the prize-table by heart and 
choose their strategies in the best possible way.
If you ask any mathematician how to write such a program, you'll learn that this is a classical minimax 
problem, which was solved decades ago, and that everyone should know about matrix games with mixed 
strategies. The croupier should choose a card at random with such probabilities that the mathematical 
expectation of the gain is independent of the card chosen by the player. And if you ask about a 
mathematical expectation, this is a kind of a mean value: the sum of possible gains multiplied by 
probabilities of getting them.

Input
The first line contains the number of cards N (1 < N â‰¤ 100). Then follows the prize-table. Each row of 
the table shows possible gains of a player who has chosen the card corresponding to the number of 
the row. The number of the column corresponds to the card chosen by the croupier. The numbers in the 
main diagonal of the table are 1000, other numbers are in the range from 0 to 10.

Output
You should output with accuracy to the fifth digit the probabilities with which the croupier should 
choose a card.
