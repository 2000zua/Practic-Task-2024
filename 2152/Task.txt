If you send a package that has a weight greater than mxw, the receiver must pay a credits for 
each kilogram over mxw. Also, if the cost of the package is greater than mxp, the receiver must 
additionally pay b percent of every credit over mxp. These fees do not count towards the cost of 
the package.
Recently employees of SKB Kontur installed a new system that would keep track of packages and 
automatically calculate fees. Egor gained access to this system and now intends to earn some quick 
money. He wants to slightly change data of at most k packages out of n packages in the warehouse. 
To slightly change data is to change exactly one digit of either the weight or the cost of the package. 
Of course, Egor wants to maximize the total fees from every package. He’ll share a percentage of his 
earnings with you if you write a program for him.

Input
The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 105), (0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the amount of packages and 
the maximal possible amount of changes.
The second line contains four integers mxw, mxp, a and b (1 ≤ mxw, mxp, a ≤ 109), (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
Each of next n lines contains integers wi and pi (1 ≤ wi, pi ≤ 109) — weight and cost of i-th package.

Output
Output one real number — the maximal possible sum of tax fees from the packages. Your answer is 
considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn’t exceed 10−9. Formally, if your answer 
is x and jury’s answer is y, your answer is considered correct if |x − y|⁄max(1, |y|) ≤ 10-9.
Then output n lines, in the i-th of them write the new weight and cost of the i-th package. 
If there are several possible answers, you may output any of them.
