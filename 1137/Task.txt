Several circular bus routes were in the city of Fishburg. None of the routes shared the same section of road, 
though common stops and intersections were possible. Fishburg old residents stated that it was possible to move 
from any stop to any other stop (probably making several transfers). The new mayor of the city decided to reform 
the city transportation system. He offered that there would be only one circular route going through all the sections
where buses moved in the past. The direction of movement along the sections must be the same and no additional sections
should be used.
Write a program, which creates one of the possible new routes or finds out that it is impossible.

O objetivo deste código é explorar todos os vértices alcançáveis a partir do último vértice da última sequência em um 
grafo direcionado. O grafo é construído com base nas sequências de entrada, onde cada sequência é uma lista de vértices 
conectados por arestas direcionadas.
