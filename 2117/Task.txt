Cyclops Polyphemus, once blinded by cunning Odysseus, have given up sheep breeding and started 
to do math. For the past time the offense on insidious Greek subsided somewhat, Polyphemus have 
analyzed the situation and now he is totally absorbed by the work on the bugs. Blind Polyphemus 
sees the root of his defeat in square root ignorance. Now they are the only topic of his research.
At the moment, cyclops is entertained by the triplets of positive integer numbers, possessing the 
following property: sum of the square roots of the first two numbers equals the square root of the
third number (in tribute to the researcher we will call such triplets Polyphemus’). 
For example, √ 7857  + √ 24832  = √ 60625  is a Polyphemus’ triplet.
To a greater extent Polyphemus was fascinated by the fact that some numbers may be part of multiple 
different Polyphemus’ triplets. For each number C Polyphemus defined z(C) as a number of pair of 
nonnegative integer numbers A ≤ B, such that √ A  + √ B  = √ C . Cyclops have found truly wonderful 
algorithm for calculating z(C) using only a compass and a ruler, but, unfortunately, because of his 
blindness Polyphemus can’t implement it in real life! That’s why you should help him find z(C).

Input
A single line contains a single integer number C, 0 ≤ C ≤ 1018.

Output
You should output a single number  — z(C).
