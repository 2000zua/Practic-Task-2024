Tyomitch plays the following game with N of his friends. Tyomitch leaves the room. 
His friends write numbers from 1 to N on cards, and each of the friends takes a card 
in a way that Tyomitch doesn't know which card each one has. Let's number the friends 
from 1 to N. After Tyomitch comes back to the room, each of his friends makes 2 statements 
of the following form (examples given for i'th friend):
1- I have the card number ai.
2- bi'th friend has the card number ci (bi ≠ i).
Exactly one of these statements is true, and the other one is false. It's known that no two 
friends said that friend b has card c, and nobody said that friend b has card c if b admitted 
that he has this very card. The task for Tyomitch is to determine for each of his friends which 
of his statements is true.

Input
The first line of the input contains the number N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000). Each of the following N lines 
contains a triple ai, bi, ci — the statements of Tyomitch's friends.

Output
The only line of output must contain N numbers separated with spaces, being the numbers of the true 
statement (either 1 or 2) for each of the friends. It is known that a solution exists.
