Once I dropped into a cafe to have a snack. I took a first course (a big round plate), a salad (a smaller round plate), 
and a cup of tea (on a small saucer). I tried to arrange all this on a rectangular tray, which was quite a problem. 
“Yes, a problem! A nice problem for the Urals Championship!”, I thought.
Now you are to solve this problem. I will give you the size of the tray and of the three plates, and you should try to 
arrange the plates on the tray.

Input
The input contains the sides of a rectangular H and W and the radii of circles R1, R2, R3. All the numbers are positive 
integers and do not exceed 106. The numbers are separated with spaces or line breaks.

Output
You should output the only number 0 if the required arrangement is impossible. Otherwise, you should output three pairs of 
numbers, which are the coordinates of the centers of the plates. The coordinates must be given in the following coordinate 
system: the origin is the corner of the tray, the X axis is directed along the side of the tray whose length is given first, 
the Y axis is directed along the other side of the tray. The order of the pairs of coordinates should correspond to the order 
of the radii given in the input data.
