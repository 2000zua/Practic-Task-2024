The are N points on the plane (N is even). No three points lie on the same straight 
line. Your task is to select two points in such a way, that straight line they 
belong to divides the set of points into two equal-sized parts.

Input
First line contains one integer N (4 ≤ N ≤ 10000). Each of next N lines contains 
pair of integers xi, yi (−106 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 106), the coordinates of i-th point.

Output
Print the numbers of selected points.
