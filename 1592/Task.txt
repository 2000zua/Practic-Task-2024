When programmer Vova was in China he discovered that Russian watches “Zarya” were sold there ten 
times cheaper than in Russia. Vova decided to make some money and bought a lot of watches. He 
wanted to sell them at home at half-price (that would be five times more expensive than he had 
paid for them). But when he returned he found out that the watches showed different times; moreover, 
from a slightest push they stopped (or started to work again). Obviously, they were not real “Zarya” 
watches, but their exact copies. In order to sell the whole lot as quickly as possible, Vova wants 
to set them all at the same time. He then will be able to say that this is the time at the producing 
plant. Of course, before opening the suitcase he will have to push it a bit to make the watches start 
to work simultaneously.
In order to set a time on a watch, Vova must rotate the winder. He can make one turn of the winder in 
one second; as he does so, the second-hand makes a complete circle. When Vova turns the winder, the 
minute-hand rotates 60 times slower than the second-hand, and the hour-hand rotates 12 times slower 
than the minute-hand. For example, to set time six hours ahead it takes six minutes. The hands of the 
watches can be rotated clockwise only. Help Vova to prepare the watches for sale. Choose a time that 
should be set on all watches so that the total time Vova spends setting it is minimal.

Input
The first line contains the number n of watches Vova bought (1 ≤ n ≤ 50000). Then there are n lines. 
The (i+1)th line of the input contains the time that the ith watch shows, in the format h:mm:ss. 
Here the integer h (1 ≤ h ≤ 12) is the hour and the two-digit integers mm and ss (00 ≤ mm, ss ≤ 59) are 
the minutes and seconds, respectively.

Output
Output the time that should be set on all watches in the format given above.
