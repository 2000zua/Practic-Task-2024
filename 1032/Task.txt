The input contains N positive integers. These integers are not necessarily different 
(so it may happen that two or more of them will be equal). Your task is to choose a 
few of given integers (1 ≤ few ≤ N) so that their sum is a multiple for N, i.e. equals
 N · k for some integer k.

Input
The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000). 
Each of the next N lines contains one integer from the given set. 
All integers are positive and not greater than 15000.

Output
If the target set of integers can not be found output the single number 0. 
Otherwise output the number of the chosen integers in the first line followed by 
the chosen integers themselves (on a separate line each) in arbitrary order.
If there are more than one set of integers with required properties you may output any of them.
